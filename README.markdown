# MIT Ph.D. Thesis template in LaTeX

This is a [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) template for a Ph.D. thesis at [MIT](http://web.mit.edu).  As far as I know, it conforms to all the [requirements](http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/thesis-specs/), at least as of 2006 when I submitted it.  There are a few things to note:

* The final output can be found here: [Kyle Jensen's MIT Ph.D. thesis](https://github.com/kljensen/mit-phd-thesis/raw/6bdb27e0d7650af6e52ee2e73ddbcb7d90f9229d/thesis.pdf)
* I'm sure successfully compiling the LaTeX document will require some debugging.
* There are a number of dependencies including tetex, pdflatex, and the [Adobe Caslon Pro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caslon) font by default.
* The main LaTeX file is just a skeleton that includes chapters in the Body/ directory using the LaTeX "\input" command.
* You can turn off the 2-sided mode in main.tex.
