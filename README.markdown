# README

This is a LaTeX framework for a Ph.D. thesis at MIT.  As far as I know, it conforms to all the requirements, at least as of 2006 when I submitted it.  There are a things to note:

* I'm sure successfully compiling the LaTeX document will require some debugging.
* There are a number of dependencies including tetex, pdflatex, and the Adobe Caslon font by default.
* The main LaTeX file is just a skeleton that includes chapters in the Body/ directory using the LaTeX "\input" command.
* You can turn off the 2-sided mode in main.tex.
