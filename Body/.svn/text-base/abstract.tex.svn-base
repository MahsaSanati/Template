In this thesis, I discuss the application and development of methods
for the automated discovery of motifs sequential data.  These data
include DNA sequences, protein sequences, and real--valued
sequential data such as protein structures and timeseries of
arbitrary dimension.  The first chapter is an introduction to the
fundamentals of motif discovery.  In the second chapter, I discuss
the use of the Teiresas motif discovery tool for the rational design
of novel antimicrobial peptides.  The third chapter details the
design of the Gemoda algorithm: a novel method for motif discovery
that enables diverse motif representations and can be applied to
nearly any kind of sequential data.  The final chapter is devoted to
a series of smaller projects, employing tools and methods
substantially different than the Teiresas and Gemoda algorithms.
